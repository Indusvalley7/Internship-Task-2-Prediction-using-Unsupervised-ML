# Internship Task 2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML
'Iris' dataset is used to predict and visualize the optimum number of clusters using the Elbow method.

## The Elbow Method
In cluster analysis, the elbow method is a heuristic used to determine the number of clusters in a data set. This method consists of plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use.
